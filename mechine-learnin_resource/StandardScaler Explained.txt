StandardScaler Explained:

### Calculating the Mean
The mean (average) of a set of numbers is found by adding all the numbers together and then dividing by the count of numbers.

#### Example with Heights
We have four heights: 170 cm, 160 cm, 180 cm, and 175 cm.

1. **Add the heights together**:
   - \( 170 + 160 + 180 + 175 = 685 \)

2. **Divide by the number of heights**:
   - There are 4 heights, so \( 685 \div 4 = 171.25 \)

So, the mean height is 171.25 cm.

### Calculating the Standard Deviation
The standard deviation measures how spread out the numbers are from the mean. Here’s a simplified way to calculate it:

1. **Find the difference between each height and the mean**:
   - For 170 cm: \( 170 - 171.25 = -1.25 \)
   - For 160 cm: \( 160 - 171.25 = -11.25 \)
   - For 180 cm: \( 180 - 171.25 = 8.75 \)
   - For 175 cm: \( 175 - 171.25 = 3.75 \)

2. **Square each difference**:
   - \( (-1.25)^2 = 1.5625 \)
   - \( (-11.25)^2 = 126.5625 \)
   - \( (8.75)^2 = 76.5625 \)
   - \( (3.75)^2 = 14.0625 \)

3. **Find the average of these squared differences**:
   - \( \frac{1.5625 + 126.5625 + 76.5625 + 14.0625}{4} = 54.6875 \)

4. **Take the square root of this average**:
   - \( \sqrt{54.6875} \approx 7.4 \)

So, the standard deviation is approximately 7.4 cm.

### Standardizing the Data
To standardize a height, subtract the mean and then divide by the standard deviation.

#### Example for 170 cm:
1. Subtract the mean: \( 170 - 171.25 = -1.25 \)
2. Divide by the standard deviation: \( -1.25 \div 7.4 \approx -0.17 \)

So, the standardized value for 170 cm is approximately -0.17.

### Using StandardScaler in Python
Here’s how you can do this in Python without worrying about the math:

```python
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
import numpy as np

# Original data
X = np.array([[170, 70], [160, 60], [180, 80], [175, 75]])

# Create a StandardScaler instance
scaler = StandardScaler()

# Fit the scaler to the data and transform it
X_scaled = scaler.fit_transform(X)

print("Original Data:\n", X)
print("Standardized Data:\n", X_scaled)
```

This code will automatically standardize your data, so you don’t have to do the calculations manually.
