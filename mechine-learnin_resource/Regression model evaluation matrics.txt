Sure! Let's break these down into simpler terms:

### R² (R-squared) or Coefficient of Determination
- **What it is**: R² measures how well your model's predictions match the actual data.
- **Range**: It ranges from 0 to 1.
  - **0** means the model does not explain any variability in the data.
  - **1** means the model perfectly explains all the variability.
- **Example**: If you have an R² of 0.8, it means 80% of the variation in the dependent variable (e.g., exam scores) is explained by the independent variable (e.g., hours studied) in your model¹¹.

### Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- **What it is**: MAE measures the average magnitude of errors in a set of predictions, without considering their direction (positive or negative).
- **How it's calculated**: Take the absolute difference between the predicted and actual values, sum them up, and then divide by the number of observations.
- **Example**: If your model predicts house prices and the MAE is \$10,000, on average, your predictions are off by \$10,000¹.

### Mean Squared Error (MSE)
- **What it is**: MSE measures the average of the squares of the errors. It gives more weight to larger errors because the errors are squared.
- **How it's calculated**: Take the difference between the predicted and actual values, square it, sum these squared differences, and then divide by the number of observations.
- **Example**: If your model's MSE is 25, it means the average squared difference between the predicted and actual values is 25⁷.

### Why Use These Metrics?
- **R²** helps you understand how well your model fits the data.
- **MAE** gives you a straightforward average error, which is easy to interpret.
- **MSE** penalizes larger errors more, which can be useful if you want to avoid large mistakes.
